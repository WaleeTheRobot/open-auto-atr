</div>

Open Auto ATR displays the median ATR for the last `Median Period`. It will auto update once the high or low of the median ATR breaks. The idea is to play the range or break out and help increase risk/reward ratios. The ATR Block displays the current ATR and the Price Distance, which is the median ATR price (gray dashed line) to the top/bottom (green/red dashed line) range of the median ATR.
