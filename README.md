Open Auto ATR displays the median ATR for the last `Median Period`. It will auto update once the high or low of the median ATR breaks. The idea is to play the range or break out and help increase risk/reward ratios.

For usage, you can download the zip containing the word import in the release page. You can import this zip file similar to importing a normal NinjaTrader Add-On. https://github.com/WaleeTheRobot/open-auto-atr/releases
